# Pages

The `Pages` directory serves as the structural backbone of the GameDay application, housing the core pages essential for its functionality. It was created to separate and organize tasks during development, aiming for improved syntax and maintainability. This folder includes the following pages:

- **Dashboard**
- **Forgot Password**
- **Home**
- **Login**
- **Signup**

These pages collectively form the skeleton of the site, providing the foundation upon which the application is built. Styling and interactive elements are managed separately in the `Components` directory, ensuring a clean separation of structure and design.
